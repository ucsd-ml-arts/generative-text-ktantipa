## Abstract

Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.

As the Halloween event is approaching, I decided to remake the horror story by using a text generator based on one of the first R.L. Stine masterpiece that makes him live up to his title: ‘Goosebumps: Welcome to Dead House’. The goal of this project is that I wanted to create a “remake’’ for this book by using rnn. See how the text generator could describe the story in its own ways. As a brief storyline, this is the story of the Benson family and their new home in Dark Falls. Come to find out, everyone in their new town is a zombie, and that every year they require new blood. That fresh blood comes from tricking families into moving into the so-called "dead house" and then murdering them. According to Glamour blog, this Goosebumps tale was our first prep for a zombie apocalypse, long before The Walking Dead. 

*My orginal idea was to generate the IT screenplay, however the remake story line doesn't make sense therefore I decided to change the story but keeping the same horror concept.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
- Repositories
